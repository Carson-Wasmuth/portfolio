    <section id="Bio">
        <p>I am currently attending SAIT for a Graphic Design Diploma. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with friends, and working on design projects. I am very excited to learn more about design and work on projects that allow me to develop my skills further.</p>

    <p>Super Mario Galaxy and Raiders of the Lost are my favourite game and movie respectively. They were both a big part of my childhood and I still love them to this day.</p>

    <h2 id="achievements">Personal Achievements</h2>
    <p>I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to attend Skills Alberta in 2019 for graphic design. This was an incredible experience and it really highlighted how interesting design is to me. I managed to achieve honors each year during high school and have also received a bachelor's degree in business with a major in general management.</p>
