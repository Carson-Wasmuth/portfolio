<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently attending SAIT for a Graphic Design Diploma. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with friends, and working on design projects. I am very excited to learn more about design and work on projects that allow me to develop my skills further.</p>

<p>Super Mario Galaxy and Raiders of the Lost are my favourite game and movie respectively. They were both a big part of my childhood and I still love them to this day.</p>
